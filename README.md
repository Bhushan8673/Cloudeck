## Supported Hardware and IoT Devices

Cloudeck is a hardware-agnostic, modular IoT SDK designed for Arduino-based IoT devices with built-in Wi-Fi.

The library is not limited to ESP devices.  
Cloudeck can be used on any Wi-Fi enabled IoT device that:
- supports the Arduino framework
- provides IP-based networking
- supports MQTT communication

This flexible design allows Cloudeck to scale across multiple IoT devices and evolve with future IoT requirements.
